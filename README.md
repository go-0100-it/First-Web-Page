# First-Web-Page

This was my second submission for the Udacity Intro to programming Nanodegree. This project was to demonstrate the basics of HTML markup and CSS styling. 
I went a little above and beyond with this project and added some basic functionality with javascript and even incorporated an interactive SVG file inline within my HTML.
The following was the project out-line:
>##Project Submission
>In this stage, you'll use a computer language called HTML and CSS and notes about the new concepts and skills you've learned so far to make your web page look professional!

>###Code Review
>Your reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on:

>###Use of Syntax: 
>All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass HTML validation and CSS validation tests.
>Use of Logical HTML Structure: Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a `<div>` or >`<span>`). Additionally, all tags should be used for their semantic purpose (ex: don't use a `<p>` tag to make a headline).
>Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling: There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. Similar HTML elements should have >the same class name.

>**IMPORTANT**: You MUST include a CSS file in your project submissions. We want you to practice linking CSS in your HTML. Simply using `<style>` tags is not sufficient enough to demonstrate your knowledge of linking CSS to your HTML file.
>###Use of Tags: 
>Page uses tags correctly. `<p>` for paragraphs. `<h1>` for main heading, etc.
>###Content Display: 
>Page display at least 1 image and some text.
